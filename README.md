# python-logic-projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains 7 Python projects developed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Treasure Island
An interactive text-based adventure game using nested conditional logic and creative ASCII art.

### 2. Library & Wishlist Manager
A management tool that uses dynamic list operations (`append`, `remove`) to track owned books and future goals.

### 3. Bunny Locator
A grid-based positioning game demonstrating 2D array manipulation and coordinate indexing.

### 4. Secure Password Generator
A tool that generates strong passwords using Python's `random` and `string` libraries.

### 5. Password Cracker Simulator
A brute-force simulation that uses `while` loops to guess a hidden password, demonstrating computational efficiency.

### 6. Caesar Cipher Tool
An encryption/decryption program implementing modular arithmetic and string processing for secure messaging.

### 7. Rock Paper Scissors
The classic game implemented with input validation and randomized computer AI.
