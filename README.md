# Python Logic & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository showcases 8 diverse projects, ranging from interactive games to mathematical models and data science basics.

## Projects Overview

### 1.Treasure Island
An adventure game that uses complex nested conditional logic (`if-elif-else`) to guide the player through a story.

### 2.Library Manager
A dynamic system for managing a book collection and wishlists using Python lists and user input validation.

### 3.Bunny Locator
A grid-based game demonstrating 2D array (matrix) manipulation and coordinate-based indexing.

### 4.Secure Password Generator
A tool that creates strong, randomized passwords using the `random` and `string` libraries.

### 5.Password Cracker Simulator
A brute-force simulation that demonstrates how loops and randomization can be used to "crack" a specific input.

### 6.Caesar Cipher Tool
An encryption/decryption program that applies modular arithmetic and string processing to secure text messages.

### 7.Rock Paper Scissors
The classic game implemented with an automated computer opponent and full input sanitization.

### 8.Linear Regression (ML from Scratch)
A data science implementation using **NumPy**. It solves the **Normal Equation** to find weights for a linear dataset, demonstrating mathematical proficiency in Python.
